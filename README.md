## Notes

Challenge 1: Running the emulator when the only issue was just needing to replace the ' with ' and a backward slash in the strings.xml

Challenge 2: When cloning the repository provided by CodePath, the layout design of adding images and text was not smooth.
(Ex: image does not move to the right, or stay in the center), solved by remaking the project from scratch.

Challenge 3: Sharing project on Github, solved by using git config commands on terminal to establish my account on github.
